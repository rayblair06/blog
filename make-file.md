## Simplify your Build Process with Makefile

I love using Makefiles to simplify and organize the build logic of my projects.

Simplify the build process by eliminating manual commands and adopting standardized `make` commands such as `make build` and `make start` to build projects across different languages and frameworks.

Organize your build logic into neat, reusable sections. Makefiles can keep your build process clean and understandable, abstracting away the complex parts of your build process and allowing you to organize your logic in one place.

You can also integrate with other tools, enabling you to run steps either in sequence or concurrently to speed up builds.

May require some additional setup on Windows ðŸ˜¬
